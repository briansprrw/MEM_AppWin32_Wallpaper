# Deploying Wallpaper Management with Microsoft Intune

Instructions on how to package, upload, and configure a wallpaper management script as a Win32 app in Microsoft Intune. This script not only copies wallpaper images but also configures the wallpaper for the user and tracks the deployment version through an environment variable.

## Prerequisites

- Microsoft Intune subscription
- Windows 10 or Windows 11 devices enrolled in Intune
- Administrative privileges on the Intune portal
- PowerShell scripting knowledge

## Packaging the Script

1. Ensure the `Install_Wallpaper.ps1` PowerShell script is correctly prepared. The script will:
   - Copy the wallpaper images to the `%SystemRoot%\Web\Wallpaper` directory.
   - Apply the wallpaper using registry settings.
   - Set an environment variable for version tracking (`WallpaperThemeVersion`).
   - Log key actions to `log.txt`.
2. Download the [Microsoft Win32 Content Prep Tool](https://github.com/Microsoft/Microsoft-Win32-Content-Prep-Tool).
3. Run the `IntuneWinAppUtil.exe` and follow the prompts to package your script and related files (e.g., wallpapers) into an `.intunewin` file.

## Uploading to Intune

1. Log in to the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center.
2. Navigate to `Apps` > `Windows`.
3. Click on `+Add` and select `Windows app (Win32)` from the app type dropdown.
4. Upload the packaged `.intunewin` file.
